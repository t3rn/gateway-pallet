# Escrow Contracts Wrapper

This module re-uses the original Contracts trait but wraps it additionally into escrow execution that may be reverted still be reverted or committed in the later execution phases.

The new functionality of escrow calls is solely contained in [`escrow_exec`](./src/escrow_exec.rs).

## Interface

### Functions

* `escrow_call` - Makes a call to an account, optionally transferring some balance. The successful execution is reverted, but all of the internal storage writes and transfers are spied on and added into the deferred collections, that may be released during commit phase or discarded during revert phase.

## Usage

The module is used by `pallet-contracts-gateway`, which integrates with `pallet-contracts` in order to dispatch the calls using the wrapped escrow calls via intermediary escrow account.
